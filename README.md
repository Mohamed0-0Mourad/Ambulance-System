# ðŸš‘ Hospital Ambulance Requests Simulation

A C++ simulation project designed to emulate the dispatch and patient management system of a multi-hospital network. The project is structured to handle real-time request simulation, dynamic patient allocation, car dispatch, and return cycles using queue-based data structures.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- **Patients**: Three types â€” Normal (NP), Special (SP), and Emergency (EP), each handled differently.
- **Cars**: Two categories â€” Ncars (normal) and Scars (specialized).
- **Hospitals**: Each maintains its own queues for patients and free cars.
- **Organiser**: A class responsible for coordinating cars and moving patients.
- **UI**: Outputs the current state of the simulation for hospitals and cars.

## ðŸ›  Features

- File-based input system to configure hospitals, cars, and request queues.
- Dynamic simulation loop processing events based on time and random chance.
- Movement of patients and cars through queues using object-oriented techniques.
- Output console interface for real-time simulation feedback.
- Organized by separate classes for clear structure and inheritance.

## ðŸ§ª Input Format

The simulator loads data from a `.txt` file following a structured format:

```txt
4             â†’ number of hospitals
110 75        â†’ speed of Scars and Ncars
3 11          â†’ hospital 1: 3 Scars, 11 Ncars
...
150           â†’ number of patient requests
NP 3 1 2 159  â†’ type, time, PID, hospital ID, distance
SP 2 4 1 588  â†’ includes distance
EP 13 4 4 433 5 â†’ includes severity
